							<ul>
								<li>analyzing and assessing privacy and security issues, risks and impacts during the design and development of new features and solutions for our products, services and delivery platform, governed by guidelines and security standards for our IT developers;</li>
								<li>ensuring confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services (for instance, we restrict access to personal information to Shichida Cloud and Shichida Myanmar employees, contractors; affiliates and other third parties described above, who need the information for the purposes described above and who are subject to strict contractual privacy and confidentiality obligations);</li>
								<li>the ability to promptly restore availability and access to personal data in the event of an incident;</li>
								<li>regular review and testing of our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, aimed to ensure security of data processing; and</li>
								<li>as we deem necessary, pseudonymization and encryption (e.g. using SSL) of data; for example, for the purpose of transfers, when data is encrypted and access is restricted at rest.</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="textjustify" style="font-size: 1.3vw">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are guided in these activities by ISO/IEC 27001:2013, the international standard that describes best practice for an information security management system and by the ‘Guide to securing personal information (‘Reasonable steps’ to protect personal information)’, dated January 2015, issued by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner.
